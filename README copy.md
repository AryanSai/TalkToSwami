# Talk to Swami

The "Talk to Swami" mobile application allows users to receive a divine message from Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.
          When the button is clicked, a message appears on the screen, offering guidance that can be seen as Swamiâ€™s answer to the question in your heart.
          Contemplating this message provides clarity and insight into your query.
          The app draws inspiration from the "Chit Boxes" found in Swami's educational institutions, where students have long sought spiritual answers.

There is also a Chrome extension counterpart of this app, which is open-sourced at:
